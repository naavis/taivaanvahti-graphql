Taivaanvahti GraphQL endpoint
=============================

Simple endpoint for GraphQL queries to astronomical association Ursa's observation database [Taivaanvahti](https://www.taivaanvahti.fi/). Currently very limited in functionality, and done to familiarize myself with GraphQL.

To run the application locally, execute the following:
```
npm install
npm start
```

You can then open the GraphQL playground by navigating to the URL `http://localhost:4000/` in the web browser.
